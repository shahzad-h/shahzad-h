### Hello, world!
I enjoy software development and cybersecurity. For the most part, I have experience with the frontend side of web apps, but I can also write backend software with NodeJS. 

I'm currently CompTIA Security+ and GSEC certified. In 2024, my [team](https://play.picoctf.org/teams/11663) placed top 40 in PicoCTF.
