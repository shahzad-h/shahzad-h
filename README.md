### Hello, world!
I enjoy software development and cybersecurity. For the most part, I have experience with the frontend side of web apps, but I can also write backend software with NodeJS. 

I'm currently CompTIA Security+ and GSEC certified. My [team](https://play.picoctf.org/teams/11663) placed top 40 on PicoCTF 2024's high school leaderboard.
