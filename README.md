### Hello, world!
**Note**: Most of my GitHub repositories can be found on my other account, https://github.com/nitrogem35.

I enjoy software development and cybersecurity. For the most part, I have experience with the frontend side of web-based projects, but I can also write backend software with NodeJS. 

One of my main projects is [takepoints.io](https://takepoints.io)*, an [open-source](https://github.com/takepoint-io) recreation of the game takepoint.io with more upgrade paths.  
In terms of cybersecurity, I'm currently CompTIA Security+ and GSEC certified.

Check out my [website](https://shahzad-h.github.io) for more information!

> ##### *I did not want to keep paying for domain renewal and monthly VPS costs out of my own pocket (at least for the forseeable future), so I took the servers offline and let the takepoints.io domain expire. However, you're free to grab copies of the prebuilt docker images and selfhost it.
